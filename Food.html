            <h2>Sichuan</h2>
            <p>This is my hometown. Sichuan province of China. (what a beautiful place isn’t it?) There are lots of delicious foods, such as Hotpot (very spicy) and other spicy but tasty food.  There are also many places of interest in Sichuan, such as Jiuzhaigou, Mount Emei and so on. And very cute pandas</p>

                    <h2>Hot Pot</h2>
                    <p>Different kinds of hot pots can be found in Chongqing and Sichuan; typically, more modern eateries offer a partitioned pot with differently-flavored broths in each section. More traditional or older establishments often serve a fragrant, mild broth in a large brass vessel heated by burning coals in a central chimney. The broth is simmered in a deep, donut-shaped bowl surrounding the chimney.

                        One of the most famous variations is the Chongqing hot pot (Chinese: 麻辣; pinyin: má là; lit. 'numb and spicy'), to which Sichuan pepper (Chinese: 花椒; pinyin: huā jiāo; lit. 'flower pepper'; also known as "prickly ash") is added. It is usual to use a variety of different meats as well as sliced mutton fillet. A Chongqing hotpot is markedly different from the types eaten in other parts of China. Quite often the differences lie in the meats used, the type of soup base, and the sauces and condiments used to flavor the meat. The typical dipping sauce contains sesame oil and is mixed with crushed fresh garlic and chopped spring onions. Due to the high humidity in the region, local people eat spicy food to remove the moisture from their bodies.[5]</p>

                    <h2>Laoma Chaoshou</h2>
                    <p>Suanla chaoshou is a dish of Szechuan cuisine that consists of a spicy sauce over steamed, meat-filled dumplings. Suanla means "hot and sour," and chaoshou is what these particular large wontons are called in the Chinese province of Sichuan.

                        Chao shou translates literally as "folded hands";[1] in Sichuan dialect this refers to a style of dumpling whose square wrapper is folded into two points, one crossed over the other. According to Peter Hessler (Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker and former Peace Corps teacher), "In most parts of Sichuan, you can walk into a restaurant and order chaoshou without making a sound. Cross your arms and they will understand exactly what you want."[2][3] One native speaker claims the Sichuan-only name for these dumplings may have originated at one time by a dialectic transposition[citation needed], i.e. "chao shou" was originally "shou chao", meaning "hand-folded".</p>

                    <h2>Dandan Noodles</h2>
                    <p>Originating from Chinese Sichuan cooking, Dandan noodles were named for the carrying pole (aka dan dan) that street vendors used to carry baskets of noodles and sauce. While sometimes served as a soup in China, American versions are usually more saucy than soupy, and often include sesame paste, peanut butter, or tahini, like the recipe below.

                        Can't find Chinese black vinegar in your local grocery store? No problem! Instead, use a mixture of 3 tbsp. water, 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, and 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar. </p>

                    <h2>Hot Spicy Douhua</h2>
                    <p>Douhua in Sichuan highly stresses the flavor of spicy, which differs from traditional favors of soy or sweet. It is served by carrying pole or bicycle vendors with several condiments such as chili oil, soy sauce, scallions, and nuts. A famous Sichuan dish, spicy tofu fish uses Douhua as an essential ingredient.[8]</p>
