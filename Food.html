              <h2>Hotpot</h2>
              <p><p>Different kinds of hot pots can be found in Chongqing and Sichuan; typically, more modern eateries offer a partitioned pot with differently-flavored broths in each section. More traditional or older establishments often serve a fragrant, mild broth in a large brass vessel heated by burning coals in a central chimney. The broth is simmered in a deep, donut-shaped bowl surrounding the chimney.</p>

              <h2>Hot Spicy Douhua</h2>
              <p>Douhua in Sichuan highly stresses the flavor of spicy, which differs from traditional favors of soy or sweet. It is served by carrying pole or bicycle vendors with several condiments such as chili oil, soy sauce, scallions, and nuts. A famous Sichuan dish, spicy tofu fish uses Douhua as an essential ingredient.[8]</p>

              <p>Suanla chaoshou is a dish of Szechuan cuisine that consists of a spicy sauce over steamed, meat-filled dumplings. Suanla means "hot and sour," and chaoshou is what these particular large wontons are called in the Chinese province of Sichuan.</p>

              <h2>Dandan Noodles</h2>
              <p>Originating from Chinese Sichuan cooking, Dandan noodles were named for the carrying pole (aka dan dan) that street vendors used to carry baskets of noodles and sauce. While sometimes served as a soup in China, American versions are usually more saucy than soupy, and often include sesame paste, peanut butter, or tahini, like the recipe below.</p>
